    <p>Headers get smaller up to a point. After that, the designer is responsible for the formatting.</p>

    <span><p>span is used to group in-line elements.</p>
    <p>on its own, it has no effect on the styling.</p>
<p>span allows us to hook CSS (cascading style sheets) to that element</p>
<p>Css was introduced in 1996, it was created to compliment HTML and makes your pages look nice.</p></span>
<p>Css can change the font, color, corners, basic animation of elements... makes it looks goooooood</p>

<div style = "background-color: darkslategray; color:honeydew">
    <p>div is used to affect more than one "line", a larger block, or the entire element. Div is often used as a container for other elements, to sytle them all with </p>

        open tag + content + close tag = element<br>
        an Attribute is a modifier that is placed inside of the opening tag of an element.
        There are 4 attributes that are shared across all tags<br>

        <ul>
            <li
            >Id - provides a document-wide identifier for an element<p id = "id-green">this is an example of the ID attribute</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                class - provides a way of classifying similar elements. a class is NOT unique, and can be shared with other elements and in other files.
                <p class = "class-blue"> this is an example of the class attribute</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                style- adds style directly to the element. RECOMMENDED: use external CSS for all styling 
                <p style = "color:red">this is an example of the style attribute</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                Title- used to attach subtext explanation to an element. This is the "tool-tip" popup that appears on your cursor.<br>
                <p Title = "Yippee!">this is an example of the title attribute</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <ol>An ordered list
            <li>
                list item
            </li>
            <li>
